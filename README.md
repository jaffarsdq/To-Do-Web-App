## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your to-do list. Enter a task description and click the "Add" button to append it to the list.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from your list with a single click. Each task item is accompanied by a "Delete" button, which, when clicked, removes the corresponding task from the list.
- **Edit Tasks:** Update task details on the fly. By clicking the "Edit" button, you can modify the description of an existing task, allowing you to keep your list up to date.

- **Get Pending Tasks:** Filter and display only the pending tasks by clicking the "Get Pending Tasks" button. This feature helps you focus on the remaining tasks that require your attention.
